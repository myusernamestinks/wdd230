    <p>Visual hierarchy is a design principle that involves organizing elements on a page
         to guide the viewer's attention. It helps prioritize content by creating a clear
          structure and emphasizing certain elements over others.It's about making some things
           stand out more than others to lead the viewer's eyes where you want them to go.</p>

    <p>The Rule of Thirds is a guideline in visual design. Imagine dividing a picture 
        into nine equal parts using two horizontal and two vertical lines. This creates a grid with nine sections. 
        The idea is to have key elements placed at intersetions to make the overall screen more visually appealing to those that visit the site.</p>

    <p>Whitespace is the empty space between and around things on a webpage. Clean design means
         keeping things simple and clear, focusing on what's important and avoiding unnecessary
          complexity.</p>
